					<p> Dearest Shan-chan,</p>
					<br>
					<p> The time we've spent together has been absolutely incredible. I'm so glad you're my friend, my partner and my qt 3.14 gf. You've taken me on so many different adventures that have changed my perspective on so many different things, from pushing my comfort zone and exploring shipwrecks to roasting thicc ribs at Moo's. You're the only person who can make painting a library exciting to me, and I love it. Our drive up the coast was probably one of the best vacations I've ever had, even if there were a few bumps along the way. I hope we both continue to grow together, and I want you to know that I'm always here for you, no matter how small an issue may be. You're so incredibly talented, and it's been such a pleasure to see you grow both as a person and an artist during our brief time together. I can't wait to see how our relationship grows, as we become the ultimate version of the Shanjaku. We can push through any problem in our way with our immense pigeon powers. <3</p>
					<br>
					<p> Sincerely yours,</p>
					<p> Jaku </p>
